# Day 1: Gacha Character Selection Challenge

In the world of gacha games, maximizing your chances to obtain coveted characters is crucial. This challenge focuses on writing a function to determine which character has the highest odds of dropping, based on provided ratios.

### Challenge Description

Write a function that accepts a variable number of objects (not an array or list!) with properties `name` (string) and `odds` (ratio-formatted string). The function should return the name of the character with the highest odds of dropping.

### Examples

- `myFunction({name: "Yinlin", odds: "1:3"}, {name: "Jianxin", odds: "1:2"})` → Should return `"Jianxin"`
- `imBadAtNames({name: "Sparkle", odds: "3:4"}, {name: "Black Swan", odds: "5:6"}, {name: "Acheron", odds: "2:3"})` → Should return `"Black Swan"`
- `snake_case_is_hard_to_type({name: "Yae Miko", odds: "3:2"}, {name: "Hu Tao", odds: "16:11"}, {name: "Fischl", odds: "10:20"}, {name: "Ganyu", odds: "133:95"})` → Should return `"Yae Miko"`
